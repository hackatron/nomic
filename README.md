# The Rules of Nomic

This repository contains a Markdown formatted version of the initial set of rules for the game [Nomic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomic).

To play, fork this repository to your own account and invite your friends to participate by creating and merging pull requests against the existing set of rules.

I'm going to keep the changes in this repository restricted to formatting and possibly adding additional sets of initial rules.
